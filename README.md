**CampusHub**



**CampusHub** is a full-stack campus management platform designed to centralize campus activities such as events and announcements. The application allows students to discover events, register for them, and stay updated with official campus announcements, while administrators can manage events and post announcements.



The project demonstrates a modern full-stack architecture using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend, along with JWT authentication and a MySQL database.
